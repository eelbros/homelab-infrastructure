## Phase 5: Cross-Cluster Integration ✅ COMPLETED  
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: Successfully completed

### Objectives Achieved
- [x] MetalLB installed and configured on k3s cluster
- [x] ArgoCD deployed on Talos cluster with LoadBalancer access
- [x] GitOps repository structure established
- [x] Multi-cluster kubectl configuration and context switching
- [x] Shared MetalLB IP pool operational across both clusters

### Technical Milestones
- **Dual MetalLB Deployment**: Both clusters sharing IP pool (10.10.20.200-250)
- **ArgoCD Installation**: GitOps platform operational with web UI access
- **LoadBalancer Services**: External access to ArgoCD (https://10.10.20.200)
- **Multi-Cluster Management**: kubectl contexts for seamless cluster switching
- **GitOps Foundation**: Repository structure ready for declarative deployments

### Production Services Running
| Service | Cluster | External IP | Status |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| k3s API | k3s cluster | 10.10.20.20:6443 | ✅ Running |
| Talos API | Talos cluster | 10.10.20.10:6443 | ✅ Running |
| ArgoCD UI | Talos cluster | 10.10.20.200 | ✅ Running |

### Skills Demonstrated
- GitOps implementation with ArgoCD
- Load balancer management across multiple clusters
- Multi-cluster Kubernetes administration
- Service exposure and networking
- Infrastructure as Code practices
