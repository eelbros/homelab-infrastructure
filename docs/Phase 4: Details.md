## Phase 4: Talos Conversion âœ… COMPLETED
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: Successfully completed

### Objectives Achieved
- [x] Server 2 converted from Proxmox to bare metal Talos Linux
- [x] Single-node Kubernetes cluster bootstrapped and operational
- [x] MetalLB load balancer installed and configured
- [x] LoadBalancer services functional (IP pool: 10.10.20.200-250)
- [x] Talos API accessible and manageable

### Technical Milestones
- **Talos Installation**: Successfully deployed immutable OS
- **Bootstrap Process**: Kubernetes control plane operational
- **Network Configuration**: Static IP (10.10.20.10) with proper routing
- **Certificate Management**: TLS certificates generated and functional
- **API Management**: 100% API-driven cluster management (no SSH)

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Control Plane Taints**: Resolved scheduling issues by adding tolerations to ArgoCD pods
2. **Certificate Authentication**: Handled TLS certificate verification for initial setup
3. **Network Configuration**: Properly configured VLAN 20 integration
4. **Missing Static Pod Manifests**: Debugged and resolved Kubernetes component startup issues

### Skills Demonstrated
- Bare metal Kubernetes deployment
- Immutable infrastructure management
- Network troubleshooting and VLAN configuration
- Certificate and PKI management
- API-driven infrastructure operations
