## Current Infrastructure State

### Cluster Summary
- **k3s Cluster**: 3 nodes (1 master, 2 workers) - Virtualized on Proxmox
- **Talos Cluster**: 1 node - Bare metal server
- **Management**: Arch Linux ThinkPad with multi-cluster kubectl setup
- **Networking**: VLAN 20 segmentation with MetalLB load balancing

### Network Allocation
```
10.10.20.1        - Gateway (PfSense)
10.10.20.10       - Talos bare metal cluster
10.10.20.20-23    - k3s cluster (master + workers)
10.10.20.100-150  - DHCP pool (reserved)
10.10.20.200-250  - MetalLB LoadBalancer pool (shared)
```

### Key Achievements
1. **Multi-architecture deployment**: Virtualized + bare metal
2. **API-driven management**: Talos immutable infrastructure
3. **GitOps implementation**: ArgoCD for declarative deployments
4. **Load balancer networking**: MetalLB across both clusters
5. **Production-ready setup**: External service access and management

## Career Development Value

### SRE Skills Demonstrated
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Git-managed configurations
- **Multi-cluster management**: Heterogeneous Kubernetes environments  
- **Immutable infrastructure**: Talos API-driven deployment
- **GitOps workflows**: ArgoCD automated synchronization
- **Network engineering**: VLAN segmentation and load balancing
- **Disaster recovery planning**: Multi-cluster redundancy design

### Technologies Mastered
- Kubernetes (k3s + Talos distributions)
- ArgoCD (GitOps platform)
- MetalLB (bare metal load balancing)
- Talos Linux (immutable container OS)
- Multi-cluster networking
- Infrastructure automation

### Interview Ready Stories
1. **"Multi-cluster Kubernetes deployment"**: Virtualized + bare metal
2. **"GitOps implementation from scratch"**: ArgoCD setup and workflows
3. **"Network troubleshooting"**: VLAN integration and load balancer config
4. **"Immutable infrastructure"**: API-driven Talos management
5. **"Production service deployment"**: LoadBalancer external access

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Control plane taints** require tolerations for single-node deployments
2. **MetalLB IP pools** can be shared across multiple clusters safely
3. **Talos bootstrap process** takes 10-15 minutes for full component startup
4. **ArgoCD UI access** requires proper LoadBalancer or ingress configuration
5. **Multi-cluster kubectl management** is essential for day-to-day operations

### Operational Best Practices
1. **Document everything** - saves hours during troubleshooting
2. **Network planning** - avoid IP conflicts between DHCP and MetalLB
3. **Git-driven workflows** - provides audit trails and rollback capability
4. **Incremental validation** - test each component before moving to next phase
5. **Multi-cluster contexts** - clear naming prevents accidental deployments

### Future Improvements
1. **Automated testing** of cluster health and application deployments
2. **Monitoring integration** for proactive issue detection
3. **Backup automation** for both cluster configuration and application state
4. **Security hardening** with network policies and RBAC
5. **Documentation automation** with infrastructure diagrams as code
